## Digital Modeling And Its Role In Our Digital World
# Joe Gibson

Digital Modeling encompasses the virtualization of physical objects whether it be for simulation, presentation, or engineering. With the ongoing pandemic and the general increase in the virtualization of everyday processes, the landscape of society is increasingly putting itself on the Internet which leads to an array of avenues and issues where digital modeling shines. 

With the ongoing pandemic, more and more people are spending an increasing amount of their time at home. Many people are unaccustomed with this lifestyle and find themselves at odds with interacting with the real world over a virtual medium. It's simple to order a pizza online or to make an Amazon order for some rolls of toilet paper. But would a person attempt to even order a complex product such as a shed, desk, or even a house virtually? Would they even trust such a purchase to meet their expectation without seeing the product in real life? 

Millenials for example already make 60% of their purchases online prior to the pandemic which has been a rising trend over the last few years<sup>1</sup>. This trend is just part of the rise of digital shopping that is occuring in most markets, so the question of how to best market more expensive and complex items to customers must then be asked. Here is where digital modeling excels through its usage of transcribing a physical space into a virtual one that can appeal to the customer's senses. 

In the case of a house, one might ask how you could even market something so large and important without having the customer be there physically. But with modern Digital Modeling, companies have found themselves able to virtualize entire houses for customers to explore as if they were really there<sup>2</sup>. This allows for people to purchase homes in places they are not in and for the housing market to exist more fully during the pandemic. And while a virtual model can't convey the "feeling" of being in the home (yet), this at least offers an avenue for realtors to move forward during this pandemic as well as open up to more clients. 

I work at IdeaRoom Technologies where we specialize in creating customizable, virtual carports and sheds for people to use to order from dealers. Our digital modeling enables dealers to reach out virtually to their customers in offering an accurate and digital representation of any building they'd like per their customizations. Here is a link to one of our customer's portals to experience: https://carportview.uscarportssteel.com/

This technology has enabled these dealers to be more complete in their presentation to their customers especially in the virtual realm we now live in today and their clients trust that their buildings will be the same as they are virtually. And with companies exhibiting a commitment to the virtual lifestyle forced by the pandemic through practices such as hiring "Heads of Remote work" and finding software that creates digital models of an officespace for their employees to virtually interact with one another in, the future of digital modeling has never been more important to understand than now<sup>3</sup>.
